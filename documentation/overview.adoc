# MapOSMacti Overview

## High level architecture

The MapOSMatic project consists of two major component:

* The OCitysMap render library
* The MapOSMatic web frontend and render daemon

These two are in the `ocitysmap` and `maposmatic` git repositories,
respectively.

Thre is also a third github repository `maposmatic-vagrant` providing
a VM test setup for development and for runing self contained local
instances.

### OCitysMap

The OcitysMap repo takes care of the actual map rendering, creating the
map content itself, and decoration like a map title bar, indexes,
annotation and copyright footer etc.

OCitysMap is implemented as a Python library, and also comes with a
command line rendering toll as an example implementation of a library
client.

OCitysMap relies on the Mapnik and CairoGraphics bindings for Python
to render actual map content, and additiona decorations.

By using Mapnik to render map content it can use the same Mapnik XML
and CartoCSS stylesheets as are usually used for map tile rendering,
and as Cairo Graphics not only supports bitmap output, but also vector
formats like PDF and SVG maps can be created using these alternative
file formats.

### MapOSMatic

The MapOSMatic repository actually provides two sub projects:

* the actual web frontend implemented using the Django framework,
  providing both a user frontend and a web API

* a render daemon that performs the actual rendering of map
  requests filed via the interactive web frontend or the API
  in the background
